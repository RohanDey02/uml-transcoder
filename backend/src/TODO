# TODO

1. Web proxy to existing SQL DDL and then port to Generation Router
2. Web proxy to existing UML and then port to Generation Router
3. Export custom RohanUML file and allow for import on FE

## Change of Scope
Instead of just SQL DDL, let's convert to any language and allow the other way around too. ✅

## Flow

### UML Image -> Any language
Upload image on FE -> Save to uploads/ -> Generate URL with path to uploadsController -> Use URL for AI generation

### Any language -> UML
Upload file on FE -> Save to uploads/ -> Generate URL with path to uploadsController -> Extract text from file and attach to the prompt -> Use for AI generation

#### Another way: If No File
Take textbox of data and attach to prompt -> Use for AI generation w/ no file

## FE Features
Button to download RohanUML and upload RohanUML to auto-populate the paper ✅

<!-- Nov 10 -->
- FE: Boxes don't fit long text. Make it so that it has dynamic sizes to fit the text ✅
- BE: `UML Diagram -> Code` should be `JSON representation -> Code` and that should be for `Export as Code`
- Still no associations implementation! Has to be reflected in the import helper func too.

<!-- Nov 11 -->
- There are different association types. Make sure the BE can differentiate between them and also add them as a choice on the FE modal
  - There are six main types of relationships between classes: inheritance, realization / implementation, composition, aggregation, association, and dependency.

<!-- Nov 12 -->
Need to allow more than 2 to be chosen on the checkbox. Not necessarily the case that the relation is only between 2 classes.
- If association, then just interconnect them. If composition, the first one is the one that the others point to. (Maybe...)
