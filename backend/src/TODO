# TODO

1. Web proxy to existing SQL DDL and then port to Generation Router
2. Web proxy to existing UML and then port to Generation Router
3. Export custom RohanUML file and allow for import on FE

## Change of Scope
Instead of just SQL DDL, let's convert to any language and allow the other way around too.

## Flow

### UML Image -> Any language
Upload image on FE -> Save to uploads/ -> Generate URL with path to uploadsController -> Use URL for AI generation

### Any language -> UML
Upload file on FE -> Save to uploads/ -> Generate URL with path to uploadsController -> Extract text from file and attach to the prompt -> Use for AI generation

#### Another way: If No File
Text textbox of data and attach to prompt -> Use for AI generation w/ no file

## FE Features
Button to download RohanUML and upload RohanUML to auto-populate the paper
